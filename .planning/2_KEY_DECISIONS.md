# Financial Aid Assistant Platform - Architecture Decisions

**Created:** 2025-08-31  
**Version:** 1.0

## Decision 1: Technology Stack - ASP.NET Core Blazor Server

### Context
Need to choose primary technology stack for rapid MVP development while leveraging existing ASP.NET Core 8.0 Blazor Server foundation already established in the project.

### Options Considered
1. **ASP.NET Core Blazor Server** (Current)
   - Real-time server-side rendering with SignalR
   - Existing project foundation
   - Strong security model for sensitive financial data
   
2. **React/Next.js with Node.js API**
   - Modern client-side framework
   - Better mobile performance
   - Requires complete rewrite
   
3. **ASP.NET Core MVC with Vue.js**
   - Hybrid approach
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Maintains .NET backend benefits

### Chosen Solution: ASP.NET Core Blazor Server

### Rationale
- Leverages existing project structure and team expertise
- Excellent security model for handling sensitive financial data
- Real-time capabilities through SignalR for progress updates
- Faster MVP delivery by building on existing foundation
- Server-side rendering reduces client-side complexity for low-bandwidth users
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for mobile experience

## Decision 2: Data Architecture - Hybrid API Integration with Local Caching

### Context
Must integrate with multiple external systems (FAFSA, state aid, institutions) while maintaining performance and handling offline scenarios.

### Options Considered
1. **Direct API Passthrough**
   - Simple proxy to external APIs
   - Real-time data only
   - No offline capability
   
2. **Full Local Database Replication**
   - Complete data synchronization
   - Complex data management
   - Regulatory compliance challenges
   
3. **Hybrid Caching with Smart Sync**
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Real-time calls for critical operations
   - Offline capability for forms

### Chosen Solution: Hybrid Caching with Smart Sync

### Rationale
- Balances performance with data freshness requirements
- Enables offline form completion for users with poor connectivity
- Reduces API call costs and rate limiting issues
- Maintains data security by caching only non-sensitive metadata
- Allows graceful degradation when external APIs are unavailable
- Supports progressive form saving and recovery

## Decision 3: AI Integration Strategy - Azure OpenAI Service with Custom Fine-tuning

### Context
Need AI capabilities for natural language processing, form assistance, and personalized recommendations while ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance.

### Options Considered
1. **Third-party AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)**
   - Advanced capabilities
   - Data privacy concerns
   - External dependency
   
2. **Azure OpenAI Service**
   - Enterprise compliance
   - Integrated with Azure ecosystem
   - Custom model fine-tuning
   
3. **Open Source Models (Hosted)**
   - Full control over data
   - Higher infrastructure costs
   - Limited pre-trained capabilities

### Chosen Solution: Azure OpenAI Service with Custom Fine-tuning

### Rationale
- Meets enterprise compliance requirements for sensitive financial data
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Azure infrastructure
- Allows custom fine-tuning on financial aid domain knowledge
- Provides required data residency and privacy controls
- Scalable and managed service reduces operational overhead
- Built-in content filtering and safety measures
