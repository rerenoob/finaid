## Critical Path Analysis

### Sequential Dependencies
1. **IMPL-001** → **IMPL-002** → **IMPL-003** → **IMPL-005**
2. **IMPL-001** → **IMPL-004** → **IMPL-003**
3. **IMPL-005** → **IMPL-006** → **IMPL-007**

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- **IMPL-004** (Document Management) can be developed in parallel with **IMPL-002** (Federal APIs)
- **IMPL-007** (PWA features) can be developed alongside **IMPL-006** (Institution Integration)
- **IMPL-008** (Testing) should be integrated throughout all development tasks

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): IMPL-001, IMPL-004
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): IMPL-002, IMPL-003  
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): IMPL-005, IMPL-006
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 13-14): IMPL-007, IMPL-008

## Next Steps
1. Begin with IMPL-001 to establish foundation
2. Set up development environment and Azure resources
