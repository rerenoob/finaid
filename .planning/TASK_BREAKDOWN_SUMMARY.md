## Dependency Map

### No Dependencies (Can Start Immediately)
- 01-foundation-infrastructure/001-azure-resources-setup
- 02-federal-api-integration/001-federal-api-research

### Foundation Dependencies
- Database Schema → Authentication → Blazor Foundation
- Azure Resources → All subsequent infrastructure tasks

### Cross-Feature Dependencies
- Federal API Client → AI Form Integration
- Database Models → All data-driven features
- Authentication → All user-facing features

## Resource Allocation

### Single Developer Timeline (Total: ~264 hours / 14 weeks)
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Foundation + Federal APIs (73 hours)
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** AI Assistant + Document Management (72 hours)  
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Dashboard + Institution Integration (65 hours)
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-14):** PWA + Testing (59 hours)

### Parallel Development (2-3 Developers)
- **Developer 1:** Foundation → Federal APIs → Dashboard
- **Developer 2:** Document Management → AI Assistant → PWA
- **Developer 3:** Testing → Institution Integration → Quality Assurance

## Quality Gates and Checkpoints

### After Foundation (Week 2)
- [ ] Azure resources deployed and accessible
- [ ] Authentication working with test users
- [ ] Database schema deployed with sample data
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional

### After Core APIs (Week 4)  
- [ ] Federal API integration tested (mock responses)
- [ ] FAFSA data models validated
- [ ] Eligibility calculations accurate
- [ ] Basic form submission working

### After AI Integration (Week 6)
- [ ] AI chat interface functional
- [ ] Smart form suggestions working
- [ ] Knowledge base searchable
- [ ] Conversation context maintained

### Before Production (Week 14)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Federal API Delays
- **Risk:** API access approval takes longer than expected
- **Mitigation:** Implement mock API responses for development continuation
- **Fallback:** Manual form submission workflow as interim solution

### AI Performance Issues
- **Risk:** OpenAI responses too slow or inaccurate
- **Mitigation:** Implement response caching and human-in-the-loop validation
- **Fallback:** Static help content and traditional form validation

### Resource Constraints
- **Risk:** Limited development capacity causes delays  
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize MVP features, defer enhancement tasks
- **Escalation:** Engage external consultants for specialized work

## Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- Tasks completed within estimated timeframes (±20% tolerance)
- Dependency violations minimized (<5% of tasks)
- Quality gates passed without major rework

### System Integration
- All features work together without conflicts
- Performance targets met under load
- User acceptance criteria satisfied

### Technical Debt
- Code coverage maintained above 80%
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
- Documentation kept current with implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1:** Begin with 001-azure-resources-setup and 001-federal-api-research in parallel
2. **Resource Planning:** Assign developers to specific task streams
3. **Environment Setup:** Provision development environments and tooling
4. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Review task breakdown with product stakeholders
5. **Progress Tracking:** Set up project management tools with task dependencies

This task breakdown provides a clear roadmap for implementing the Financial Aid Assistant Platform with manageable, testable increments that maintain system stability throughout development.
