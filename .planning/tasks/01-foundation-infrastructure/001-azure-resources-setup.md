# Task: Set up Azure Resources and Environment Configuration

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-001 - Foundation and Infrastructure Setup
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- None (Starting task)

### External Dependencies
- Azure subscription with required service quotas
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Access to domain management for custom domains

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `Infrastructure/azure-resources.bicep`: Infrastructure as Code definition
- `appsettings.Production.json`: Production configuration settings
- `appsettings.Development.json`: Development environment settings
- `.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml`: Infrastructure deployment pipeline
- `docs/deployment-guide.md`: Deployment documentation

### Code Patterns
- Use Azure Bicep for Infrastructure as Code
- Follow Azure naming conventions for resource groups and services
- Implement least-privilege access policies

### Azure Resources to Provision
```bicep
// Key resources to create
- Resource Group: rg-finaid-prod
- App Service Plan: asp-finaid-prod (Standard S1)
- App Service: app-finaid-prod
- SQL Server: sql-finaid-prod
- SQL Database: sqldb-finaid-prod (Basic tier)
- Redis Cache: redis-finaid-prod (Basic C0)
- Application Insights: appi-finaid-prod
- Key Vault: kv-finaid-prod
- Storage Account: stfinaidprod (for document storage)
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All Azure resources provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Connection strings configured in Key Vault
- [ ] Application Insights logging working
- [ ] SSL certificate configured for custom domain
- [ ] Resource tagging implemented for cost tracking
- [ ] Infrastructure deployment pipeline functional
- [ ] Backup policies configured for SQL Database
- [ ] Network security groups configured appropriately

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: N/A (Infrastructure task)
- Integration tests: Connection string validation
- Manual validation: 
  - Access each Azure service through portal
  - Verify App Service can connect to SQL Database
  - Confirm Redis cache connectivity
  - Test Application Insights telemetry

## System Stability
- All resources use managed services for high availability
- Infrastructure is documented for easy recreation
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures defined
- Rollback strategy: Delete resource group if deployment fails
