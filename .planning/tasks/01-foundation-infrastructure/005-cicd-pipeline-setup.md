# Task: Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Deployment

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-001 - Foundation and Infrastructure Setup
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 001-azure-resources-setup.md: Azure resources deployed
- [ ] 004-blazor-app-foundation.md: Blazor app structure established

### External Dependencies
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Azure service principal with deployment permissions
- SonarCloud account for code quality scanning

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Continuous integration pipeline
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml`: Continuous deployment pipeline
- `.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml`: Infrastructure deployment
- `scripts/deploy.ps1`: Deployment helper scripts
- `tests/HealthChecks/`: Application health check endpoints
- `Directory.Build.props`: Common build properties and versioning

### Code Patterns
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Use Azure CLI for deployment operations
- Implement proper secret management with GitHub Secrets
- Use semantic versioning for releases

### CI/CD Pipeline Structure
```yaml
# CI Pipeline stages
name: Continuous Integration
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    - Restore dependencies
    - Build application
    - Run unit tests
    - Code coverage analysis
    - Security scanning (OWASP)
    - Code quality analysis (SonarCloud)
    - Publish artifacts

  deploy-staging:
    - Deploy to staging environment
    - Run integration tests
    - Smoke tests
    - Performance benchmarks
    
  deploy-production:
    - Manual approval gate
    - Blue-green deployment
    - Health checks validation
    - Rollback capability
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI pipeline runs on all pull requests and merges to main
- [ ] All unit tests must pass before deployment
- [ ] Code coverage threshold enforced (80% minimum)
- [ ] Security scanning detects and fails on high-severity issues
- [ ] Automated deployment to staging environment on main branch updates
- [ ] Production deployment requires manual approval
- [ ] Database migrations applied automatically during deployment
- [ ] Health checks validate successful deployment
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented
- [ ] Build artifacts versioned and stored appropriately

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Pipeline step validation logic
- Integration tests: End-to-end deployment process
- Manual validation:
  - Trigger CI pipeline with test changes
  - Verify staging deployment works correctly
  - Test production deployment process
  - Validate rollback functionality
  - Confirm all security gates function properly

## System Stability
- Zero-downtime deployments using Azure deployment slots
- Automated rollback on health check failures
- Database migration rollback procedures documented
- Infrastructure as Code ensures environment consistency
