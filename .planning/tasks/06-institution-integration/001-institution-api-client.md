# Task: Build Institution API Integration Client

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-006 - Institution and Scholarship Integration
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 02-federal-api-integration/002-api-client-foundation.md: HTTP client patterns established

### External Dependencies
- Institution partnership agreements and API access
- Common Application API credentials
- Institution-specific API documentation

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `Services/Institution/InstitutionApiService.cs`: Main API client
- `Services/Institution/IInstitutionApiService.cs`: Service interface
- `Models/Institution/InstitutionProfile.cs`: Institution data models
- `Models/Institution/TuitionData.cs`: Cost and pricing information
- `Configuration/InstitutionApiSettings.cs`: API configuration

### Code Patterns
- Multi-tenant API client supporting different institution APIs
- Standardized data mapping across institution systems
- Rate limiting and quota management per institution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration with 10+ major educational institutions
- [ ] Real-time tuition and fee data retrieval
- [ ] Institution-specific aid program information
- [ ] Application deadline synchronization
- [ ] Cost comparison data standardization

## Testing Strategy
- Integration tests with mock institution APIs
- Data accuracy validation against known institution data
- Rate limiting compliance verification

## System Stability
- Fallback to cached data when institution APIs unavailable
- Error handling for various institution API formats
- Circuit breaker pattern for unreliable institution endpoints
