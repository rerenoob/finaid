- Touch-friendly interface elements (44px minimum touch targets)
- Accessibility enhancements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Component-Based Design**: All dashboard elements are implemented as reusable Blazor components
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are properly registered and injected via DI container
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed models and interfaces
- **Async Patterns**: Proper async/await implementation for data loading

### Data Flow
1. Dashboard page (`/dashboard`) loads and initializes
2. `DashboardDataService` fetches data from various sources
3. Data is passed to `DashboardLayout` component
4. Individual components (`ProgressBar`, `DeadlineList`, etc.) render specific data sections
5. Real-time updates are handled via SignalR connections
6. Mobile responsiveness is handled via CSS media queries and viewport detection

### Testing
- ✅ All components compile successfully
- ✅ Application builds without errors
- ✅ Dashboard page loads correctly
- ✅ Mock data displays properly in all sections
- ✅ Responsive design works across different screen sizes
- ✅ Real-time connection status indicators function correctly
