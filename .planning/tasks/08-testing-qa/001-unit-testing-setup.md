# Task: Establish Comprehensive Unit Testing Framework

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-008 - Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 01-foundation-infrastructure/002-database-schema-design.md: Models available for testing

### External Dependencies
- xUnit testing framework
- Moq for mocking dependencies
- TestContainers for database testing
- bUnit for Blazor component testing

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `Tests/UnitTests/Services/`: Service layer unit tests
- `Tests/UnitTests/Models/`: Model validation tests
- `Tests/UnitTests/Components/`: Blazor component tests
- `Tests/TestHelpers/`: Common test utilities
- `Tests/Directory.Build.props`: Test project configuration

### Code Patterns
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for test structure
- Mock external dependencies with Moq
- Use TestContainers for database integration tests
- bUnit for Blazor component testing with JSInterop mocking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 80%+ code coverage for service layer
- [ ] All critical business logic covered by unit tests
- [ ] Blazor components tested with various input scenarios
- [ ] Mock implementations for external dependencies
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests execute in under 5 minutes total
- Parallel test execution for improved performance
- Clear test naming conventions for maintainability

## System Stability
- Tests isolated with no dependencies between test cases
- Database tests use clean state for each test
- Mock external services prevent external dependencies in tests
