# Task: Implement Service Worker for PWA Functionality

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-007 - PWA and Offline Capabilities
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 05-dashboard-progress/005-mobile-responsive-dashboard.md: Mobile optimization complete

### External Dependencies
- Service Worker API support across target browsers
- Cache API for offline data storage
- Background Sync API for form submission queuing

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `wwwroot/sw.js`: Service worker implementation
- `wwwroot/manifest.json`: PWA manifest file
- `Services/PWA/OfflineSyncService.cs`: Background sync logic
- `Models/PWA/CachedFormData.cs`: Offline form data models
- `wwwroot/js/pwa-install.js`: Installation prompts

### Code Patterns
- Cache-first strategy for static assets
- Network-first strategy for dynamic data
- Background sync for form submissions
- Push notification support for deadline reminders

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Forms work offline with sync when connection restored
- [ ] App installable on mobile home screens
- [ ] Push notifications for critical deadlines
- [ ] Offline indicator in UI when network unavailable
- [ ] Background sync queues form submissions

## Testing Strategy
- Offline functionality testing across browsers
- Installation flow testing on mobile devices
- Background sync validation with network simulation

## System Stability
- Graceful degradation when service worker unsupported
- Cache size management prevents storage overflow
- Sync conflict resolution for offline form submissions
