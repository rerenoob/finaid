# Task: Build Federal API Client Foundation and Authentication

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-002 - Federal API Integration Layer
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 001-federal-api-research.md: API requirements and authentication documented
- [ ] 01-foundation-infrastructure/002-database-schema-design.md: Database context available

### External Dependencies
- HttpClient factory configured in DI container
- Azure Key Vault for secure credential storage
- Federal API credentials and certificates (when approved)

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `Services/Federal/FederalApiClientService.cs`: Main API client implementation
- `Services/Federal/IFederalApiClient.cs`: Interface definition
- `Models/Federal/AuthenticationRequest.cs`: API authentication models
- `Models/Federal/ApiResponse.cs`: Generic response wrapper
- `Configuration/FederalApiConfiguration.cs`: API configuration settings
- `Middleware/FederalApiLoggingMiddleware.cs`: Request/response logging
- `Tests/Unit/Services/FederalApiClientTests.cs`: Unit tests

### Code Patterns
- Use IHttpClientFactory for HTTP client management
- Implement retry policies with Polly library
- Follow API client patterns from existing codebase
- Use strongly-typed configuration with IOptions<T>

### API Client Architecture
```csharp
public interface IFederalApiClient
{
    Task<ApiResponse<T>> GetAsync<T>(string endpoint, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<ApiResponse<T>> PostAsync<T>(string endpoint, object payload, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<bool> ValidateConnectionAsync();
}

public class FederalApiClientService : IFederalApiClient
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    private readonly ILogger<FederalApiClientService> _logger;
    private readonly FederalApiConfiguration _config;
    
    // Implementation with authentication, retry logic, and error handling
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] HTTP client properly configured with base URL and headers
- [ ] Authentication mechanism working (OAuth/API key as determined)
- [ ] Retry policies implemented for transient failures
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for various API response codes
- [ ] Request/response logging implemented for debugging
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance built into client
- [ ] Connection validation method working
- [ ] Secure credential management through Azure Key Vault
- [ ] Unit tests covering happy path and error scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests with mock API responses

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Authentication logic, retry policies, error handling
- Integration tests: Mock API server responses for various scenarios
- Manual validation:
  - Test connection validation with valid/invalid credentials
  - Verify retry behavior with simulated failures
  - Confirm logging captures all necessary information
  - Test rate limiting compliance

## System Stability
- Graceful degradation when federal APIs unavailable
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
- Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting
- No blocking calls that could freeze the UI
