# Task: Research and Document Federal API Requirements

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-002 - Federal API Integration Layer
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- None (Research task can run in parallel)

### External Dependencies
- Access to Federal Student Aid documentation
- Contact with Federal Student Aid API support team
- Legal/compliance team for regulatory requirements

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `docs/federal-api-research.md`: Comprehensive API documentation
- `docs/compliance-requirements.md`: Legal and regulatory requirements
- `Models/Federal/ApiModels.cs`: Federal API data models (stub)
- `Configuration/FederalApiSettings.cs`: Configuration structure
- `docs/api-integration-plan.md`: Technical integration approach

### Code Patterns
- Document all API endpoints and data formats
- Identify authentication and authorization requirements
- Map federal data structures to internal models
- Plan for API versioning and changes

### Research Areas
```markdown
## Key Research Topics
1. FAFSA API Access Requirements
   - Application process and approval timeline
   - Authentication mechanisms (OAuth, API keys)
   - Rate limiting and usage restrictions
   - Data access permissions and scope

2. Available Endpoints and Data
   - Student eligibility verification
   - Application submission endpoints
   - Status checking and tracking
   - Award calculation services
   - Document upload/verification

3. Compliance Requirements
   - FERPA regulations for student data
   - Data retention and deletion policies
   - Audit logging requirements
   - Security and encryption standards
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete documentation of all available federal APIs
- [ ] Clear understanding of application process and timeline
- [ ] API authentication requirements documented
- [ ] Data models mapped between federal and internal systems
- [ ] Compliance requirements fully understood and documented
- [ ] Rate limiting and usage restrictions identified
- [ ] Fallback strategies identified for API unavailability
- [ ] Cost implications of API usage documented
- [ ] Contact established with federal API support team

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: N/A (Research task)
- Integration tests: N/A (Research task)
- Manual validation:
  - Verify all documentation is accurate and complete
  - Confirm compliance requirements with legal team
  - Validate technical feasibility with development team
  - Review findings with stakeholders

## System Stability
- Research task has no impact on system stability
- Findings will inform technical decisions for subsequent tasks
- Documentation serves as reference for future development
- Compliance understanding prevents regulatory violations
