# Task: Integrate AI Assistant with FAFSA Form Components

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-003 - Intelligent Form Assistant
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 003-chat-interface-component.md: Chat interface working
- [ ] 02-federal-api-integration/003-fafsa-data-models.md: FAFSA models implemented
- [ ] 02-federal-api-integration/004-eligibility-service.md: Eligibility calculations available

### External Dependencies
- Blazor EditForm components
- Client-side validation libraries
- Form state management patterns

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `Components/Forms/IntelligentFormAssistant.razor`: Main form with AI integration
- `Components/Forms/SmartFormField.razor`: AI-enhanced form field component
- `Components/Forms/FormSectionWithAI.razor`: Form section with contextual help
- `Services/Forms/FormAssistanceService.cs`: AI form assistance logic
- `Services/Forms/IFormAssistanceService.cs`: Service interface
- `Models/Forms/FormFieldContext.cs`: Form field context for AI
- `Models/Forms/FormValidationSuggestion.cs`: AI validation suggestions
- `wwwroot/js/smart-form.js`: Client-side form enhancement

### Code Patterns
- Use Blazor EditForm with custom validation
- Implement real-time AI suggestions as user types
- Follow existing form component patterns
- Use event callbacks for form field interactions

### Smart Form Integration Architecture
```csharp
public interface IFormAssistanceService
{
    Task<FormFieldSuggestion> GetFieldSuggestionAsync(string fieldName, object currentValue, FormContext context);
    Task<List<ValidationSuggestion>> ValidateFieldAsync(string fieldName, object value, FormContext context);
    Task<string> ExplainFieldRequirementAsync(string fieldName, FormContext context);
    Task<object> SuggestFieldValueAsync(string fieldName, FormContext context);
}

@code {
    // Smart form field with AI assistance
    [Parameter] public string FieldName { get; set; } = null!;
    [Parameter] public object Value { get; set; } = null!;
    [Parameter] public EventCallback<object> ValueChanged { get; set; }
    
    private string? aiSuggestion;
    private bool showHelp = false;
    
    private async Task OnFieldFocusAsync()
    {
        var suggestion = await FormAssistanceService.GetFieldSuggestionAsync(
            FieldName, Value, GetCurrentFormContext());
        aiSuggestion = suggestion.HelpText;
    }
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AI provides contextual help for each form field
- [ ] Real-time field suggestions based on user input
- [ ] AI explains complex financial aid terminology
- [ ] Form validation enhanced with AI-powered suggestions
- [ ] Auto-completion suggestions for common fields
- [ ] Intelligent error detection and correction suggestions
- [ ] Form progress tracking integrated with AI guidance
- [ ] AI remembers user preferences and pre-populates similar fields
- [ ] Accessibility maintained with screen reader support
- [ ] Performance optimized to prevent UI lag during AI calls

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Form assistance logic, validation suggestions, field suggestions
- Integration tests: AI service integration, form state management
- Manual validation:
  - Test AI suggestions for various form fields
  - Verify contextual help appears appropriately
  - Test form validation with AI enhancements
  - Confirm auto-completion works correctly
  - Test accessibility with assistive technologies

## System Stability
- Graceful degradation when AI service unavailable
- Form remains functional without AI assistance
- Caching of common suggestions improves performance
- Error handling prevents form submission issues
