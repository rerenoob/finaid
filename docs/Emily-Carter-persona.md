**Personal Story & Goals**

Emily is a bright and curious teenager with a strong desire to pursue a college degree, even though no one in her immediate or extended family has gone to college. She attends a small public high school where the college-going culture is minimal, and resources are limited—there’s one guidance counselor serving over 300 students. Most of her peers either go straight into the workforce or attend a local trade school.

Despite the barriers, Emily dreams of studying **elementary education** because she wants to return to her community and teach. She’s been working part-time at the local grocery store since she was 15 to save money for college, and she tutors middle schoolers after school. Her mother is supportive but doesn't know how the financial aid process works or how to guide Emily through it.
