# Financial Aid Assistant - Manual Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions for manually testing the frontend-backend integration of the Financial Aid Assistant application.

## Application Overview

The application is a Blazor Server application with the following key features:
- **Dashboard**: Overview of application progress and deadlines
- **FAFSA Application**: Traditional form-based FAFSA completion
- **FAFSA with AI Assistant**: AI-powered form completion with smart suggestions
- **Document Management**: Secure document upload and management
- **Progress Tracking**: Application status and completion tracking

## Testing Environment

- **URL**: http://localhost:5033
- **Database**: SQLite (finaid-dev.db)
- **Authentication**: Mock authentication (development mode)
- **File Storage**: Azure Blob Storage emulator (development mode)
- **AI Services**: Mock responses (Azure OpenAI not configured)

## Manual Test Cases

### 1. Basic Navigation
- [ ] Navigate to Home page (/) - should show welcome message
- [ ] Navigate to Dashboard (/dashboard) - should show progress cards
- [ ] Navigate to FAFSA Application (/fafsa) - should show form overview
- [ ] Navigate to FAFSA with AI Assistant (/fafsa-ai) - should show AI form
- [ ] Navigate to Documents (/documents) - should show upload interface
- [ ] Navigate to Progress (/progress) - should show completion status

### 2. Dashboard Functionality
- [ ] Verify progress bars show mock data (65% completion)
- [ ] Check that deadline cards display upcoming dates
- [ ] Verify activity feed shows recent actions
- [ ] Test refresh functionality
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

### 3. FAFSA Form Testing
- [ ] Test basic form fields (text inputs, dropdowns)
- [ ] Verify form validation works
- [ ] Test navigation between form sections
- [ ] Verify progress tracking updates
- [ ] Test save progress functionality (mock)
- [ ] Test form submission (mock)

### 4. AI Assistant Integration
- [ ] Verify AI chat interface loads
- [ ] Test form field suggestions (mock)
- [ ] Verify context-aware help displays
- [ ] Test error prevention suggestions
- [ ] Verify personalized recommendations

### 5. Document Management
- [ ] Test file upload interface
- [ ] Verify drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Test file type validation (PDF, JPG, PNG, TIFF)
- [ ] Verify file size validation (50MB limit)
- [ ] Test upload progress tracking
- [ ] Verify document list displays
- [ ] Test document deletion (mock)

### 6. Progress Tracking
- [ ] Verify overall progress calculation
- [ ] Check individual application status
- [ ] Test deadline tracking
- [ ] Verify next steps recommendations
- [ ] Test progress visualization

### 7. Backend Integration
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Test background services (OCR processing, status updates)
- [ ] Verify dependency injection works
- [ ] Test service layer responses
- [ ] Verify error handling

## Mock Data Configuration

The application uses mock data for development testing:

### User Data
```csharp
User currentUser = new() 
{ 
    Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
    FirstName = "Test", 
    LastName = "User", 
    Email = "test.user@example.com" 
};
```

### Application Progress
- FAFSA: 65% complete, In Progress status
- State Aid: 0% complete, Not Started status
- Mock deadlines: 15 days (FAFSA), 7 days (Documents)

### Document Upload
- Mock file processing
- Simulated OCR results
- Mock virus scanning

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Tests
- All pages should load without errors
- Navigation should work smoothly
- Forms should accept input and validate
- Mock data should display correctly
- Progress indicators should update
- File upload interface should function

### Known Limitations (Development Mode)
- Real Azure OpenAI integration not configured
- Actual federal API calls are mocked
- File storage uses local emulator
- Email notifications are simulated
- Push notifications disabled

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database not found**: Run `dotnet ef database update`
2. **Application won't start**: Check port 5033 is available
3. **File upload fails**: Ensure Azure Storage emulator is running
4. **AI features not working**: Azure OpenAI not configured in development

### Logs and Debugging
- Check application logs in console output
- Enable detailed logging in appsettings.Development.json
- Use browser developer tools for frontend debugging
- Check database file (finaid-dev.db) for data issues

## Next Steps for Production Testing

1. Configure real Azure services
2. Set up production database
3. Enable real authentication
4. Configure federal API integration
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Perform load testing
7. Conduct security testing
